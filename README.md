# adventofcode

Here one can find my solutions to the AoC 2021 challenges, I have done.

I only commit those which have aquired stars.

Each folder up to 15 consists of a rust project, which solves the given problem of the advent-calendar.
* `exa*.txt` representes the given examples from the exercise definition.
* `challenge.txt` represents the challenge I got by the system

From folder 16 on, the examples are inside test environments and the program just runs the file `input`.

Note that I usually do not focus on error-management due to wrong input file formats.

The problems can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2021
